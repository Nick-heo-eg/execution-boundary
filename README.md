# execution-boundary

**Execution Boundary** defines a single invariant:

> **Execution is not created without judgment.**

This repository is a **public entry point**, not an implementation.

---

## What this is

Execution Boundary describes a structural condition under which execution is **impossible to exist**.

It is not a workflow choice.
It is not a safety heuristic.
It is not human-in-the-loop.

Judgment is treated as a **hard precondition**, not an advisory signal.

---

## What this is not

This repository does **not** provide:

* a framework
* a library
* a runtime
* a policy engine
* a governance product

It contains no enforcement code and no metrics.

---

## Why this exists

Most AI governance mechanisms focus on:

* improving decisions, or
* explaining outcomes after execution.

Execution Boundary governs **before execution exists**.

If judgment does not occur, execution is never created.

---

## Where the boundary is defined

The operational specification and proofs live in the following repositories:

* **AI Execution Boundary Specification**
  [https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/ai-execution-boundary-spec](https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/ai-execution-boundary-spec)

* **Judgment Boundary (Canonical, Sealed)**
  [https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/judgment-boundary](https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/judgment-boundary)

* **Stop-First Operational Proofs**
  [https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/stop-first-operational-proof](https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/stop-first-operational-proof)

* **Decision-Only Observability**
  [https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/decision-only-observability](https://github.com/Nick-heo-eg/decision-only-observability)

---

## Scope

This boundary is:

* model-agnostic
* runtime-agnostic
* policy-agnostic
* regulation-agnostic

Compliance and oversight are **consequences**, not design goals.

---

## Final note

This repository does not aim to make AI "safer".

It defines **when execution is not allowed to exist**.
