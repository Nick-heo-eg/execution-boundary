POLICY ALIGNMENT
========================================

Client-Side Config:
- auto_allow_threshold: 1
- deterministic_mode_enabled: true
- strict_risk_score_enforcement: true
- destructive_action_score: 10
- force_block: true

Gateway Runtime:
- auto_allow_threshold: 1 (loaded from policy file)
- deterministic_mode: true
- destructive_action_score: 10
- force_block: true
- X-Approve override: DISABLED

Alignment Status:
✓ auto_allow_threshold: ALIGNED (both=1)
✓ deterministic_mode: ALIGNED (both=true)
✓ destructive_blocking: ALIGNED (both enforce risk>=10)
✓ policy_file_loading: SUCCESS
✓ runtime_enforcement: SUCCESS

========================================
CRITICAL VALIDATIONS
========================================

Execution Call Prevention:
✓ STOP verdicts blocked execution BEFORE execution_call()
✓ 7 STOP verdicts → 7 executions prevented
✓ 0 architectural violations

Deterministic Mode Enforcement:
✓ Content analysis: DISABLED
✓ Environment heuristics: DISABLED
✓ X-Approve override: DISABLED
✓ Verdicts based solely on: risk_score vs threshold

Destructive Operations Blocking:
✓ rm -rf: BLOCKED (risk=10)
✓ docker --privileged: BLOCKED (risk=10)
✓ sudo: BLOCKED (risk=8)
✓ All force block rules: ACTIVE
